        1. Pokémon GO
    </h2>
    <h3>
        Pokémon Go (stylized as Pokémon GO) is a 2016 augmented reality (AR) mobile game, part of the Pokémon franchise,
         developed and published by Niantic in collaboration with Nintendo and The Pokémon Company for iOS and Android devices.
          It uses mobile devices with GPS to locate, capture, train, and battle virtual Pokémon,
           which appear as if they are in the player's real-world location. The game is free-to-play; 
           it uses a freemium business model combined with local advertising and supports in-app purchases for additional in-game items.
            The game launched with around 150 species of Pokémon, which had increased to around 700 by 2021.

Pokémon Go was released to mixed reviews; critics praised the concept but criticized technical problems.
 It was one of the most used and profitable mobile apps in 2016, having been downloaded more than 500 million times worldwide
  by the end of the year. It is credited with popularizing location-based and AR technology, promoting physical activity, 
  and helping local businesses grow due to escalated foot traffic. However, it attracted controversy for contributing to accidents
   and creating public nuisances. Various governments expressed concerns about security, and some countries regulate its use. 
   The game had over 147 million monthly active users by May 2018, over a billion global downloads by early 2019, 
   and grossed more than $6 billion in revenue by 2020.

        3. Minecraft
    </h2>
    <h3>
        Minecraft is a 2011 sandbox game developed and published by Mojang Studios for Windows. 
        Originally created by Markus "Notch" Persson using the Java programming language, 
        it was developed over the span of two years, with many public test builds being released from May 2009 
        until its full release on 18 November 2011. After the game's full release,
         Persson gave Jens "Jeb" Bergensten control over the game's development. In the years since its release,
          it has been ported to several platforms, including smartphones and various video game consoles, primarily by 4J Studios.
           Minecraft has become the best-selling video game in history,
            with over 300 million copies sold and nearly 140 million monthly active players as of 2023.

        In Minecraft, players explore a procedurally generated, three-dimensional world with virtually infinite terrain made up of "voxels".
         Players can discover and extract raw materials, craft tools and items, and build structures, earthworks,
          and machines. Depending on their chosen game mode, players can fight hostile mobs,
           as well as cooperate with or compete against other players. The games two main modes are a survival mode
           , where players must acquire resources to survive, and a creative mode where players have unlimited resources
            and the ability to fly. Several other game modes exist besides the two main ones, such as one that allows players 
            to spectate others and one that plays identically to survival mode, but features permadeath. 
            The game's large community also offers a wide variety of user-generated content, such as modifications, servers, 
            skins, texture packs, and custom maps, which add new game mechanics and possibilities.

        4. Roblox
    </h2>
    <h3>
        Roblox is an online game platform and game creation system developed by Roblox Corporation
         that allows users to program and play games created by themselves or other users. 
         Created by David Baszucki and Erik Cassel in 2004 and released in 2006, 
         the platform hosts user-created games of multiple genres coded in the programming language Lua.
         
         For most of Roblox's history, it was relatively small, both as a platform and as a company. 
         Roblox began to grow rapidly in the second half of the 2010s, and this growth has been accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic.
         [10][11]

Roblox is free to play, with in-game purchases available through a virtual currency called Robux.
 As of August 2020, Roblox had over 164 million monthly active users, including more than half of all American children under 16.
 [12][13] Although Roblox has received generally positive reviews from critics, it has faced criticism for its moderation,
  microtransactions, and allegations of exploitative practices toward children.

        6. Subway Surfers
    </h2>
    <h3>
        Subway Surfers[a] is an endless runner mobile game which is co-developed by Kiloo and SYBO Games,
         private companies based in Denmark. It is available on Android, iOS, HarmonyOS, Amazon Fire Tablet,
          and Windows Phone platforms and uses the Unity game engine.[2] In the game, players take the role of young graffiti artists,
           led by Jake who, upon being caught in the act of tagging a metro railway site,
            run through the railroad tracks to escape from the inspector and his dog. As they run, they grab gold coins,
             power-ups, and many other items while simultaneously dodging collisions with trains and other objects.
              They can also jump on top of the trains and surf with hoverboards to evade capture until the character crashes into an obstacle,
               gets caught by the inspector, or gets hit by a train, at which point the game ends. Special events, such as the Season Hunt 
               and others, including the game's birthday events, the Super Runners Challenge and Rivals Challenge,
                can result in in-game rewards and characters.

        7.Among Us
    </h2>
    <h3>
        Among Us is a 2018 online multiplayer social deduction game developed and published by American game studio Innersloth. 
        The game allows for cross-platform play; it was released on iOS and Android devices in June 2018 and
         on Windows later that year in November. It was ported to the Nintendo Switch in December 2020 and on the PlayStation 4,
          PlayStation 5, Xbox One and Xbox Series X/S in December 2021. A virtual reality adaptation, Among Us VR,
           was released on November 10, 2022.

Among Us takes place in space-themed settings where players are colorful, armless cartoon astronauts.
 Each player takes on one of two roles: most are Crewmates, but a small number are Impostors.
  Crewmates work to complete assigned tasks in the game while identifying and voting out suspected Impostors
   (who appear identical to Crewmates) using social deduction, while Impostors have the objective of killing the Crewmates.
    The game was inspired by the party game Mafia and the science fiction horror film The Thing.

While the game was initially released in 2018 to little mainstream attention,
 it received a massive rise in popularity in 2020 due to many Twitch streamers and YouTubers playing it during the COVID-19 pandemic. 
 It received favorable reviews from critics for fun and entertaining gameplay.
  The game and its stylized characters have been the subject of various internet memes.

        9. Candy Crush Saga 
    </h2>
    <h3>
        Candy Crush Saga is a free-to-play tile-matching video game released by King on April 12, 2012, originally for Facebook;
         other versions for iOS, Android, Windows Phone, and Windows 10 followed. It is a variation of their browser game Candy Crush.[1]

In the game, players complete levels by swapping colored pieces of candy on a game board to make a match of three or more of the same color,
 eliminating those candies from the board and replacing them with new ones, which could potentially create further matches.
  Matches of four or more candies create unique candies that act as power-ups with larger board-clearing abilities.
   Boards have various goals that must be completed within a fixed number of moves, such as collecting a specific number of a type of candy.


The game uses a freemium model; while it can be played completely through without spending money, 
players can buy special actions to help clear more difficult boards, from which King makes its revenues—at its peak,
 the company was reportedly earning almost $1 million per day.[2] Around 2014, over 93 million people were playing Candy Crush Saga,
  while revenue over a three-month period as reported by King was over $493 million.[3] Five years after its release on mobile,
   the Candy Crush Saga series has received over 2.7 billion downloads, and the game has been one of the highest-grossing and 
   most-played mobile apps in that time frame. As of September 2023, it had reached over $20 billion in lifetime revenue.[4]

        10. Angry Birds
    </h2>
    <h3>
        Angry Birds (also known as Angry Birds Classic) was a 2009 physics-based casual puzzle video game developed
         by Finnish video game developer Rovio Entertainment. Inspired primarily by a sketch of stylized wingless birds,
          the game was first released for iOS and Maemo devices starting in December 2009.[1][2] By October 2010, 
          12 million copies of the game had been purchased from the iOS App Store and Ovi,
           which prompted the developer to design versions for other touchscreen-based smartphones, most notably Android, Symbian, 
           Windows Phone, and BlackBerry 10 devices. The series has since expanded to include titles for dedicated video game consoles
            and PCs. A sequel, Angry Birds 2, was released in July 2015 for iOS and Android. Around April 2019, 
            the original game was removed from the App Store.[6] A paid recreation of the game's content from 2012 was
             released as Rovio Classics: Angry Birds on March 31, 2022,[7] but later on, Rovio mentioned that they were removing it 
             from the Google Play Store on February 23, 2023, and retitling it as Red's First Flight on the iOS App Store.

The gameplay revolves around players using a slingshot to launch the birds at green pigs stationed in or around various structures,
 with the intent of destroying all of the pigs on the playing field. As players advance through the game, new types of birds become
  available (some with special abilities that can be activated by the player mid-flight). Rovio Mobile has supported Angry Birds with
   numerous free updates that add additional game content, and the company has also released stand-alone holiday and promotional 
   versions of the game.

Angry Birds was eventually praised by critics for its success at leveraging a combination of addictive gameplay, comical style,
 and low price into a viable franchise with long-term potential for profit. The game's popularity has led to the release 
 of Angry Birds games for personal computers and gaming consoles, created a market for merchandise featuring the Angry Birds characters,
  a 2016 feature-length animated film, two sequels to said film, and several seasons of television cartoons. The Angry Birds series
   had a combined tally of over five billion downloads across all platforms, as of April 2022, including special editions.[8]
    After its release, the original game was called "one of the most mainstream games out in 2010,"[9] "one of the great runaway hits 
    of 2010,"[10] and "the largest mobile app success the world has seen as of 2011."[11
